  "musicbio": "Louis Pino is a percussionist, electronicist, and software engineer who works in a wide range of musical genres and other media. His performative and compositional practices are mostly influenced by cyclical time, neural entrainment, and the sound of his cat's purr. Pino prefers to work on music incorporating theatrical elements and the use of technology, and has curated and performed solo recitals of entirely theatrical music and entirely electroacoustic music. More recently, Pino has been applying these ideas to his ensemble, Duo Cichorium, along with fellow percussionist and interdisciplinary artist Jasmine Tsui. Pino is also an active chamber musician, acting as both percussionist and Technical Director of Toronto based chamber ensemble, The Happenstancers. Pino is also a founding member of The Black Fish Ensemble, and is featured on their Juno nominated album, The Black Fish. As an orchestral player, Pino was awarded the National Youth Orchestra of Canada’s Award of Excellence and maintains an active performance schedule with The National Arts Centre Orchestra, among others.\n In addition to performance and composition, Pino is an avid educator and researcher. He has given masterclasses on snare drum performance at the University of Toronto, along with additional workshops on the visual coding language Max/MSP. From 2021 to 2023, Pino was Research Associate and Lab Manager at the Technology and Performance Integration Research Lab at the University of Toronto, focusing on musical biofeedback, collaborative multimedia composition, and pedagogical live electronics. His contributions to the lab’s output included five international academic conference presentations and a peer-reviewed paper publication."
